# Levi Keay's project portfolio site [under development]
Created from the Jekyll theme **WhatATheme**. Find WhatATheme's [**Demo Here**](https://thedevslot.github.io/WhatATheme/)

I hope to continue to add short writeups of past projects I have done to have a place to showcase my interests.

### Installation

I installed this theme website by forking the [WhatATheme Repository](https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme/). I host the site on Github Pages, with no local Ruby/Jekyll environment!

### Writing Posts

WhatATheme has both posts and projects templates. I intend to use this site more as a project portfolio, however I have found the post template to be easier to work with. I will likely eventually remove the projects tab from my site for simplicity. 

To write a post, I start with the markdown documents provided in the _posts_ directory as a template, or create a new markdown document in that directory. When the site is built this will automatically generate a new post.

### Larger changes made to the theme template:

I've made edits to HTML files in the repository in order to style the page to my liking. This includes removing blog post dates and read times in the blog card display. 

A key addition to the Gemfile is 
>gem "webrick"

This allows the site to build using the newest ruby update.

Thank you to [thedevslot](https://github.com/thedevslot/WhatATheme/) for this useful and stylish template.
