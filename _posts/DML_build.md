description: My first speaker build, inspired by Tech Ingredients youtube channel. They are an interesting different approach to speaker design from conventional woofer based designs, and I recommend this project as a cheap entrypoint to DIY audio.

### Introduction

When I first came across [Tech Ingredients' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIye4RZ-5k&ab_channel=TechIngredients) on distributed mode loudspeakers (DMLs), I was intrigued to try building a set for myself. One of the main draws for me is the way in which these speakers operate in a fundamentally different way to conventional speakers, with the oscillations along the large faces of the panels producing sounds waves, rather than the pistonic motion of a woofer as is used in conventional speakers. In his video, Tech Ingredients rigourously tests a variety of materials and shapes of panel, and provides detailed instructions for build recommendations. I mostly follow these instructions in my build.

The touted benefits of DML's include improved sound-staging/imaging when used as a stereo set up, and a versatile _almost_ full range speaker with a pleasant, more musical sound than is found in conventional woofer-driver design. Furthermore, they can be constructed from relatively cheap components. After building them myself, I do believe that for the cost of materials they provide a superior sound to what would be acheivable with equivalent funds spent towards woofers, drivers, cabinet enclosures and crossovers that would be needed to build or buy a set of conventional speakers of similar performance in terms of range and frequency response. A breakdown of material costs can be seen below:

| item | cost |
|---|---|
|DAEX32EP-4 Thruster 32mm Exciter 40W 4 Ohm | ~$60/ pair |
|Extruded Polystyrene panel, 8'x2' | ~$40 |



## Bass response

One of DML's greatest downsides is a lack of bass output. The lowest frequency that a DML can output is a function of the diagonal corner-to-corner distance of the panel. [This webpage](https://dmlspeakers.com/articles/Does%20Size%20Really%20Matter) provides a nice widget providing a convenient computation of the lowest frequency achievable by a given panel size. My 2 panels were built to be 4' x  2' each, and by this calculation their **lowest audible frequency is 99 Hz, with a low end falloff at 174 Hz.** While I haven't measured this with proper equipment, it seems inline with my experience of setting crossover frequencies for my subwoofer.
