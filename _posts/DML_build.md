description: My first speaker build, inspired by Tech Ingredients youtube channel. They are an interesting different approach to speaker design from conventional woofer based designs, and I recommend this project as a cheap entrypoint to DIY audio.

### Introduction

When I first came across [Tech Ingredients' video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKIye4RZ-5k&ab_channel=TechIngredients) on distributed mode loudspeakers (DMLs), I was intrigued to try building a set for myself. \
These speakers operate in a fundamentally different way to conventional speakers, with the oscillations along the large faces of the panels producing sounds waves, rather than the pistonic motion of a woofer as conventional speakers use.
